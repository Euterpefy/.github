# Euterpefy: Open-Source Music Recommender

Welcome to Euterpefy, an open-source music recommendation project developed by Phuoc Khai Nguyen. The project focuses on providing personalized music recommendations to users by leveraging the extensive Spotify API.

- The project's mobile app is made as a project for the CS4750 (Mobile App Development) course at Cal Poly Pomona.

## Project Overview

Euterpefy is now a primarily web-based application, with the mobile app project being limited to the CS4750 course. 
- The `server-side` repo has been deprecated and is no longer in use.

### Mobile App (Flutter & Dart)

The Euterpefy mobile app was developed as part of the CS4750 course. It integrates with Spotify to provide the following features:

- **User Authentication:** Integrates with Spotify to access user-specific data, ensuring that recommendations are tailored to individual tastes.
- **Real-Time Data Fetching:** Makes direct requests to the Spotify API to fetch real-time, personalized content.
- **User Interface:** Provides a sleek and responsive user interface built with Flutter & Dart, allowing for an enjoyable and intuitive user experience.

### Open-Source Web Application

The main component of the Euterpefy project is the open-source web application, hosted in the `webapp` repository of the Euterpefy GitHub organization. This web application is open for contributions and aims to extend the reach of Euterpefy by providing a browser-based interface to the music recommendation service. The app is hosted at https://euterpefy.khainguyen.dev.

#### Contributing to the Web App

The web application is actively looking for contributors! Whether you're interested in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development, there are opportunities to contribute:
